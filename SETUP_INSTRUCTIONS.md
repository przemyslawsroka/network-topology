   - Shows current project with dropdown to switch between projects
   - Includes demo projects: `przemeksroka-joonix-service`, `my-demo-project-123456`, `production-env-789012`

2. **Left Sidebar Menu**
   - Already existed with "Network Topology" as the main navigation item
   - Styled to match GCP's interface design

3. **D3.js Force-Directed Graph**
   - Created interactive network topology visualization with demo data
   - Shows different node types: Regions, VPCs, Instances, Services
   - Interactive features: drag nodes, zoom/pan, pause/resume simulation
   - Color-coded nodes and links based on type and status
   - Legend and controls for better user experience

4. **GCP-style Layout**

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Note**: The package.json has been updated to include d3.js and @types/d3. If you encounter network issues during npm install, you might need to install d3 separately:

```bash
npm install d3@^7.8.5 @types/d3@^7.4.3
```

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
cd frontend
npm run start:dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

### 3. What You'll See

- **Header**: Google Cloud branding with project picker and user menu
- **Sidebar**: Navigation menu with Network Topology selected
- **Main Content**: 
  - Interactive D3.js network topology graph showing demo infrastructure
  - Information cards describing features below the graph

## Demo Data

The network graph includes sample GCP infrastructure:
- **Regions**: us-central1, us-east1, europe-west1
- **VPCs**: Production, Staging, Development
- **Instances**: Web servers, database server, cache server
- **Services**: API Gateway, Load Balancer, Cloud SQL
- **Connections**: Network links, VPC peering, VPN connections

## Customization

To add your real GCP data:

1. **Replace demo data** in `src/app/features/network-topology/components/network-graph/network-graph.component.ts`
2. **Update project list** in `src/app/shared/components/project-picker/project-picker.component.ts`
3. **Connect to GCP APIs** to fetch real infrastructure data

## File Structure

```
frontend/src/app/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/components/project-picker/     # Project picker component
â”œâ”€â”€ layout/main-layout/                   # Main layout with header and sidebar
