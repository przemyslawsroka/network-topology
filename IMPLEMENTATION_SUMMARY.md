# Network Topology Dynamic Edge Implementation

## Summary

Successfully updated the network-topology feature to dynamically fetch edges from GCP metrics instead of using hard-coded data. The topology now displays real network connections based on the same edge exploration used in metric-edge-explorer.

## Changes Made

### 1. Network Graph Component (`network-graph.component.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added `@Input()` decorators for `nodes` and `links` to accept dynamic data
- Implemented `OnChanges` lifecycle hook to respond to data updates
- Made node and link types flexible (changed from union types to string)
- Added `metricValue` field to Link interface to display metric data
- Created `updateGraph()` method to re-render the graph when data changes
- Added helper methods:
  - `getNodeClass()` - Maps various node types to CSS classes
  - `getLinkClass()` - Maps link types to CSS classes
  - Extended `getNodeRadius()` to support more node types (Zone, Country, Load Balancer, etc.)
- Added link labels to display metric values on edges

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic graph rendering based on input data
- Support for multiple node types from GCP metrics
- Displays metric values on network connections
- Fully reactive to data changes

### 2. Topology View Component (`topology-view.component.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Injected `MetricDataService` to fetch edge data
- Added state management:
  - `nodes`: Array of graph nodes
  - `links`: Array of graph edges
  - `isLoading`: Loading state indicator
  - `latencyInfo`: Performance metrics
- Implemented `fetchTopologyData()` method:
  - Fetches all available granularities from MetricDataService
  - Queries all metric types (egress_bytes_count, load balancer metrics, VPN, interconnects)
  - Tracks latency and success/failure rates
- Created `transformConnectionsToGraph()` method:
  - Converts metric connections to graph nodes and links
  - Prevents duplicate nodes and edges
  - Generates unique IDs based on type and name
- Added `refreshData()` method for manual data refresh

**Latency Tracking:**
```typescript
interface LatencyInfo {
  totalLatency: number;        // Total time to fetch all data
  metricCount: number;          // Number of metrics queried
  connectionCount: number;      // Total connections found
  successCount: number;         // Successful queries
  failureCount: number;         // Failed queries
}
```

### 3. Topology View Template (`topology-view.component.html`)

**Added:**
1. **Latency & Statistics Card**
   - Displays load time prominently
   - Shows metrics queried, connections found, nodes, edges
   - Success/failure rate for queries
   - Refresh button to reload data

2. **Loading Spinner**
   - Displays while fetching data from GCP
   - Shows loading message

3. **Updated Network Graph**
   - Now receives dynamic `[nodes]` and `[links]` inputs
   - Hidden during loading state

### 4. Topology View Styles (`topology-view.component.scss`)

**Added:**
- `.latency-card` - Styled card with blue accent border
- `.stats-grid` - Responsive grid layout for statistics
- `.stat-item` - Individual stat display with label and value
- `.loading-card` and `.loading-content` - Centered loading spinner layout
- Color coding for different stat types (primary, success)
- Responsive design considerations

## Data Flow

```
1. TopologyViewComponent.ngOnInit()
   ↓
2. fetchTopologyData()
   ↓
3. MetricDataService.getAvailableGranularities()
   → Returns all possible edge types:
     - Instance to Instance
     - Instance to Subnet
     - Zone to Zone
     - Region to Region
     - Load Balancer connections
     - VPN Tunnel connections
     - Interconnect connections
     - etc.
   ↓
4. MetricDataService.getMetricData(allGranularities)
   → Queries all metrics in parallel using forkJoin
   → Each query tracks its own latency
   ↓
5. transformConnectionsToGraph(results)
   → Extracts unique nodes from connections
   → Creates links between nodes
   → Preserves metric values
   ↓
6. Graph updates via [nodes] and [links] bindings
   ↓
7. NetworkGraphComponent.ngOnChanges()
   ↓
8. updateGraph() renders the topology
```

## Metrics Fetched

The topology now automatically queries all these edge types:

**VM Flow Metrics:**
- Instance → Instance
- Instance → Subnet
- Instance → Zone
- Instance → Region
- Instance → Country
- Instance → Business Region
- Subnet → Subnet
- Zone → Zone
- Region → Region

**Load Balancer Metrics:**
- Country → Load Balancer
- Load Balancer → Instance Group

**VPN & Interconnect:**
- Instance → VPN Tunnel
- Instance → VLAN Attachment

## Performance Display

The latency card shows:
- **Total Load Time**: End-to-end time to fetch and process all metrics
- **Metrics Queried**: Number of different metric types queried
- **Connections Found**: Total network connections discovered
- **Nodes**: Unique network entities in the graph
- **Edges**: Connections between nodes
- **Query Success**: Success rate of metric queries

## Benefits

1. **Real Data**: Shows actual network connections from GCP metrics
2. **Comprehensive**: Fetches all available edge types automatically
3. **Performance Visibility**: Shows exact latency for data loading
4. **Scalable**: Automatically adapts to available metrics
5. **Maintainable**: Follows the same pattern as metric-edge-explorer
6. **User Control**: Refresh button to reload latest data

## Usage

Navigate to the Network Topology page to see:
1. A statistics card at the top showing load time and metrics
2. The network graph displaying all discovered connections
3. Nodes colored by type (regions, instances, services, etc.)
4. Edges showing metric values (egress bytes, request bytes, etc.)
5. A refresh button to reload the latest data

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Filter by metric type or granularity
- Time range selector for historical data
- Click on nodes/edges to see detailed metrics
- Export topology data
- Save/load topology snapshots
