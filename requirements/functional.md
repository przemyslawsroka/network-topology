# Functional Requirements

## Overview
This application will provide a network topology visualization similar to Google Cloud Platform's Network Topology feature, built using network metrics and VPC flow logs to display network infrastructure and traffic flows.

## Core Features

### 1. Network Topology Visualization
- **FR-001**: Display interactive network topology graph showing network resources and their relationships
- **FR-002**: Visualize network components including:
  - VPC networks
  - Subnets
  - Virtual machines/instances
  - Load balancers
  - Firewalls
  - Routers and gateways
  - External connections

### 2. High-Level Metrics View
- **FR-003**: Provide high-level network overview using aggregated metrics
- **FR-004**: Display key network performance indicators:
  - Total network traffic volume
  - Active connections count
  - Bandwidth utilization
  - Latency metrics
  - Error rates
- **FR-005**: Show real-time and historical metric trends

### 3. VPC Flow Logs Integration
- **FR-006**: Process and analyze VPC flow logs to understand traffic patterns
- **FR-007**: Display traffic flows between network components with:
  - Source and destination information
  - Protocol details (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Port information
  - Traffic volume and direction
- **FR-008**: Identify top talkers and traffic patterns
- **FR-009**: Detect anomalous traffic flows

### 4. Interactive Graph Features
- **FR-010**: Enable zoom and pan functionality for network graph navigation
- **FR-011**: Provide node selection and detailed information display
- **FR-012**: Implement filtering capabilities:
  - By resource type
  - By traffic volume
  - By time range
  - By network zone/region
- **FR-013**: Show/hide different types of connections and resources
- **FR-014**: Search functionality for specific network resources

### 5. Data Management
- **FR-015**: Ingest and process network metrics from monitoring systems
- **FR-016**: Parse and store VPC flow log data
- **FR-017**: Maintain historical data for trend analysis
- **FR-018**: Support real-time data updates with configurable refresh intervals

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting
- **FR-019**: Define and monitor network health indicators
- **FR-020**: Generate alerts for network anomalies or performance issues
- **FR-021**: Provide network status dashboard with health indicators

### 7. Export and Reporting
- **FR-022**: Export topology diagrams in various formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- **FR-023**: Generate network analysis reports
- **FR-024**: Export filtered data sets for further analysis
